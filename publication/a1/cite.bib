  abstract = "Blockchain, as the foundation for cryptocurrencies, has recently
              garnered significant attention. It serves as an immutable
              distributed ledger technology, which allows transactions to be
              carried out reliably in a decentralized environment.
              Blockchain-based applications are emerging, covering numerous
              fields, including financial services, reputation systems, the
              Internet of Things, and more. However, blockchain technology
              still faces several challenges, such as scalability, security,
              and other unresolved issues that need to be overcome. This
              article provides a comprehensive overview of blockchain
              technology and its applications. We commence with a summary of
              the development of blockchain, followed by an examination of the
              blockchain architecture and a systematic review of the research
              and application of blockchain technology in different fields from
              the perspectives of academic research and industry technology.
              Additionally, we briefly outline the technical challenges and
              recent developments. We also explore possible future trends in
              blockchain. Received: 24 July 2023 | Revised: 15 September 2023 |
