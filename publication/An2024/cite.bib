abstract = {With the vigorous development of Internet technology, the scale of systems in the network has increased sharply, which provides a great opportunity for potential attacks, especially the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. In this case, detecting DDoS attacks is critical to system security. However, current detection methods exhibit limitations, leading to compromises in accuracy and efficiency. To cope with it, three key strategies are implemented in this paper: (i) Using tensors to model large-scale and heterogeneous data in complex networks; (ii) Proposing a denoising algorithm based on the improved and distributed tensor train (IDTT) decomposition, which optimizes the tensor train(TT) decomposition in terms of parallel computation and low-rank estimation; (iii) Combining (i), (ii) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classification model, an efficient DDoS attack detection framework is proposed. Datasets CIC-DDoS2019 and NSL-KDD are used to evaluate the framework, and results demonstrate that accuracy can reach 99.19% while having the characteristics of low storage consumption and well speedup ratio.}
